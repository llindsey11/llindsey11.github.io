      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">Rocket League originated from a game called "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars" which was played on the play station 3, but now it has transformed into rocket league and I love this game a lot. I mostly play when I am bored of the other games on this list.</div>

      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">I started playing Fortnite a month or two after battle royal first came out and I played so much during that year because I dropped sports my sophomore year of highschool and I got extremely good at the game but I have slowed down on playing it a couple months ago due to the developers ruining the game.</div>

      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">This is by far my favorite COD game that has been released, everyone prefers the original but I like how fast pace TDM and FFA were, my favorite weapons were the MORS Sniper with default scope and the ASM1 Speakeasy.</div>

      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">This is a game I plaued with my father and younger brother, It was created to be a mixture of Ark and that satisfying block type building that minecraft has, very relaxing game to play.</div>

     <div align="center" style="color:#828282">Ark has always been a game I love to play, the mystery of the storyline fascinates me and seeing all the creatures and being able to interact and even ride and use them is really fun. PVP gets frustrating after grinding for hours then getting wiped by and Alpha tribe, I have only been Alpha on time on an Ark server.</div>

            <div align="center" style="color:#828282">This 2D cartoon style fighting game never ceases to disappoint me, the matches aren't dragged out and boring, the game is super fast pace, and when you win or lose the next match is always loaded up in less than 30-45 seconds. There is never a wait to play and I am very good at this game so I love it. (Favorite Character is Ada)</div>

      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">I love the 2D block style and the combat, unlocking special abilities has always been a little something I love. The adventure vs. creation is pretty equal and so it's a super fun game to play.</div>

      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">The game everyone knows and loves, I couldn't count the amount of endless hours I have spent on this game from when I was younger, starting out just exploring randomly generated worlds, then to creative buiding, red stone contraptions, factions on servers, and finally playing competitively on certain gamemodes.</div>

      <div align="center" style="color:#828282">The game I can always rely on to give me a challenge but also a good time, after boss fights were too easy I would lower my characters stats to make it harder. The boss fights were amazing, the exploration is amazing, the building is amazing.</div>
